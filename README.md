# Socket-Programming
Chat application having server and client connection using socket programming

In this chat application, socket programming is used to facilitate real-time messaging between users.

The server is responsible for handling incoming connections and managing communication between clients. The server creates a socket and binds it to a specific port, allowing clients to connect to that port. Clients connect to the server by creating a socket and specifying the server's IP address and port number.
